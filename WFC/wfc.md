One challenge of indie game development is about striking a balance. Specifically, the balance between hand crafted level design,
player replayability, and the lack of enough hours in a day to commit to being brilliant at both. This is where people turn to
procedural generation as a tool to help strike that balance. One of the most magical and interesting tools in the proc gen toolbox is
Wave Function Collapse (WFC). In this article, we'll dive into the how/why of WFC, and how you can add this tool to your repertoire for
game development.
